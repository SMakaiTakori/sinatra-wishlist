## Welcome to the My Wishlist App!

This is a Sinatra MVC app that stores and keeps track of all your important wishlists.
In order to use this app, clone it and run "bundle install" to install the dependencies.
Run shotgun in your terminal and go to the localhost on the specific port shown in the terminal.

## Usage

Create your user by selecting signup on the welcome page, or log in if you already have an account.

You will then be taken to your 'My Wishlists' page.

From here you can select the 'New Wishlist' button in the navigation bar to create your very own wishlist.

After entering in the name of your wishlist, and the quantity and item(s) that you want, click the Create button to finalize your wishlist. 

You will be taken back to your wishlists page, where you will now see your newly created wishlist!

If you click the title of your wishlist, you will see two buttons where you are able to edit and/or delete it.

Another option you can select is 'All Users', which brings you to a page where you can see all other user accounts. 
By clicking another user's name, you will be able to see wishlists they have created.

You can also choose to see 'All Wishlists', which shows you a list of the wishlists created by all current users.

You also have the option to select 'Log Out' to log out of your account. 

Have Fun!
